The wake word is `Hello Spotify`

We are using `3.8.16`

Please use this version otherwise some of the libraries wont work

First install the requirments: 
`pip install requirments.txt`

Then run the main python file:

`python main.py`

Once you see the output of `Listening` on the screen, press enter and you are ready to talk, and the program will listen and output `True` or `False` based on what it hears
